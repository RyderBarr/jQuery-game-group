Karam Abbas notice:

Official project is in the dumbed down branch.
Some features are cut such as the grid size options and power ups because I couldn't figure out how to fix all of the borders, 
the leftover snake image on startup, and put in all of the power ups.
I also had to do collisions with the snake itself and that took a while to figure out.

Sorry.
